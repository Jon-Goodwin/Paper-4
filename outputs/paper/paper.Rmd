abstract: "Water source and availability are important factors in determining the health and safety of a society. We obtain data regarding the source of water in Jordan and the time it takes residents to access it. We find that the most common source of water is piped into residents, and that a significant portion of Rural residents are receiving water through a tanker truck. These findings have implication for the further development of infrastrcuture in Jordan."

# Introduction {#Intro}

  Sources of water are important in understanding the living conditions of the population of Jordan. Most of the population that answered the survey do use a piped water source into their residence. Access to water both in a timely manner and low cost is important to allowing people to live a secure life.

  We analyzed the sources of water for two subsets of the Jordan population, urband and rural residents. From Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig2), we can see that both urban and rural residents primarly source their water from pipes into their residence directly. However we also find that tanker trucks make up a significant source of water for rural residents.

  This information is relevant to the further development and enhancement of living conditions for rural and urban residents of Jordan. Gaps in the availability of water for rural and urban residents can be identified and addressed by the Government of Jordan.

  In section \@ref(Data) we talk about the process of gathering and analyzing the dataset. Then in section \@ref(Results) we discuss the implications of the dataset presented. Finally in section \@ref(Discussion) we discuss implications for the Jordan residents, as well as the weakness of the study and the further investigation that may be useful to the topic of water security for the residents of Jordan.

# Data {#Data}

  The dataset is from the Jordan Population and Family Health Survey(JPFHS). The survey was conducted by the Department of Statistics, [@citeDOS] from June 7, to October 31, of the year 1997,through the Demographic and Health Survey(DHS) program.The survey was funded by the U.S Agency for International Development, while Macro International Inc. provided technical support of the survey.

  The survey covers 7600 households, the sample is nationally representative, the intent of the survey was to provide information on levels of fertility, infant and child mortality and family planning. Of this survey, this analysis is focused on the information regarding the source of water and the time availability of water. This information was available in the JPFHS report on page 32, table 2.7.
  
  To compile the data set, the R language was used[@citeR], along with the packages, Pointblank [@citepointblank], haven [@citehaven], the paper was compiled using Knitr [@citeknitr] and KableExtra[@citeakableExtra] packages. The table was acquired through the PDF document using the package PDFtools [@citepdftools]. Also made use of reshape2 [@citereshape2] in manipulating the data to creae plots.

Table \@ref(tab:tab1) gives a small look at the dataset.

```{r tab1, echo = FALSE, fig.pos = 'H'}

```

  There are a total of 10 different sources of water captured by the survey, Piped into residence, Public tap, well in residence, public well, spring, rainwater, tanker truck, bottled water, and other. 

  Respondents were grouped into two categories, urban and rural. The last variable is a total for the entire population.

  Additionally the time to the water source is given as an over or under of 15 minutes. And this is also divided between urban, rural and total variables.

\newpage

# Results {#Results}

  From Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) we see a breakdown comparing the urban and rural residents sources of water, along with a total for the population of Jordan. From this table we see that the vast majority of residents from both populations receive their water via a pipe directly into their residence. This is a positive as it means these people have quick and direct access to a water source.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Bar plot of water sources"}
### Bar plot of water sources ###
df <- data[-11,]
df1 <- df[-1,]
df_long <- melt(df1)
p <- ggplot(df_long, aes(x = Characteristic, y = value, fill = variable)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  xlab("Source of Water") +
  ylab("Percent of Population")

p + coord_flip()
```


\newpage

  In Figure \@ref(fig:fig2) we take a closer look at a similar plot but with the piped into residence source removed to better see the alternatives to piped water sources. Most of these sources notably are attributed to rurarl residents, with no source accounting for even 5% of the urban population.

```{r fig2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Bar plot without piped into residence response"}
### Reduced Bar Plot ###
df.2 <- data[-11,]
df.2 <- df[-1,]
df.2 <- df.2[-1,]
df_long2 <- melt(df.2)
q <- ggplot(df_long2, aes(x = Characteristic, y = value, fill = variable)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  xlab("Source of Water") +
  ylab("Percent of Population")

q + coord_flip()
```

  Unsurprisingly the majority of natural water sources such as wells are being used by rural residents, making up 3.7% of all rural water sources compared to the 1.1% asmong urban residents. Also Springs are only used by rural residents, making up 2.3% of rural sources. The relatively large number of tanker truck sources for rural residents is somewhat surprising considering in many parts of the Western world the main alternative to piped water sources would presumably be a well. More information regarding this seemingly strange occurence is given in section \@ref(FirstPoint)
  
  

```{r fig3, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Water available within 15 minutes",fig.width=4,fig.height=3}
### Bar plot showing water availability ###
df.3 <- data[11,]
df_long3 <- melt(df.3)
q <- ggplot(df_long3, aes(x = Characteristic, y = value, fill = variable)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Percent of Population")

q
```

  As we can see both rural and urban residences can access water quite readily  in the country of Jordan. With rural residents slightly trailing, though that's not unexpected.

# Discussion {#Discussion}

## Water in Jordan {#FirstPoint}

  According to the United States Agency for International Development[@citeUSAID] "Jordan is one of the most water-scarce countries in the world", the country faces problems with it's ground water resources being drained twice as fast as they can be replenished. This explains the lack of use of wells we see in the country in the dataset and the possible over reliance on bottled and tanker truck water among the rural population.

  According to [@citeUSAID] one of the primary issues affecting Jordan is the loss of water through leaky pipes, theft and underbilling, the metering of water in the population. Brookings[@citeBroook] also notes that although much of the population has water piped into their residence much of that population only receives 12hours of water supply per week.
  
  Since Jordan lacks naturally occurring water resources the effective transportation of their water is going to be the primary way the country can reduce the costs of delivering water to its citizens. To meet these challenges iniatives like the Jordan Water Project[@citeJWP] are being developed.

## Weaknesses and next steps

  More information regarding the availability deficiencies would be the next steps. With pipes being both the primary source but also according to points made in section \@ref(FirstPoint) it's not just important for Jordan that residents have piped water for easy access but also the quality of those piped sources as the country faces issues of water conservation. Further investigation regarding the quality of those pipes would help to establish a better idea of the water

If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset does not rely on any external sources.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the data is all publicly available from the Department of statistics Jordan and required no special permissions to access.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The sub populations are urban and rural residents of Jordan.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No individuals can be identified from the dataset.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- None of the data is of a sensitive nature.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- No.
